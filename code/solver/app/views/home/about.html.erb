<h3>Travelling Salesman Problem</h3>
<p>
	The Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a classical combinatorial problem that involves visiting each 
	city once and minimising the overall tour length. The difficulty of the problem is that as the number 
	of cities (n) increases, so does the number of possible tours from which the minimum must be selected (0.5*(n-1)!).

</p>

<p>
	Computational problems are organised into common classes of difficulty. Those problems that cannot be solved in
	polynomial time are referred to as NP-hard and represent some of the hardest known computational problems.
	The TSP belongs to a sub-set of NP-hard called NP-complete, highlighting the innate difficulty of the 
	problem (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP-hard"></>more</a>...)		
</p>

<p>
	The TSP is a well studied problem in computer science and there are many specialised resources on the web
	dedicated to interested researches. TSPLIB provides a library of sample problems that may be used when
	empirically investigating instances of the general class of problem. This site selected common
	instances of the Euclidean TSP with known solutions from TSPLIB.

<h3>Crowdsourcing</h3>
<p>
	Crowdsourcing is an outsourcing technique where a problem is partitioned into sub-problems
	and assigned to a crowd of people for solving. The sub-solutions are then collected and aggregated 
	back into a holistic solution. The web provides an popular platform for this form of problem solving.
	(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowdsourcing"></>more</a>...)	
</p>

<p>
	A powerful application of the crowdsourcing model involves harnessing problem solving capabilities of humans
	toward solving problems that are too difficult for computers. This approach has been used to address machine vision
	and pattern	recognition problems and is referred to as Human Computation.

<h3>Human TSP Solver</h3>
<p>
	The site was built to investigate the question: 
	<center>
	<b>Can human spatial intelligence be harnessed to solve instances of the Travelling Salesman Problem?</b>
	</center>
</p>	

<p>
	The approach taken involves: 
	(1) partitioning TSP instances into sub-problems, 
	(2) allowing users to make contributions in the context of the sub-problems, and 
	(3) aggregating the contributions into a holistic solution. 	
	A database of problems is maintained, and contributions are recorded against instances of those problems,
	where an instances are rotated periodically.
</p>

<p>
	Sub-problems are selected randomly with re-selection of sub-problems. The process involves 
	firstly the selection of a random city in the broader problem, then the selection of a limited 
	number of cities with a minimum distance to the selected origin city.
</p>

<p>
	Contributions are provided by users in the form of edges between cities in presented sub-problems.
	There is no discrimination of of contributions, meaning that users are free to contribute 
	whatever they feel may be relevant or useful to the problem .
	Contributions are aggregated and stored as a frequency for each distinct edge in an 
	incidence adjacency list.
</p>

<p>
	The stored contributions provide a summary of those edges that are expected to be useful in solving
	the broader TSP (far fewer than the possible set of edges). These may be explored by a deterministic or
	probabilistic algorithm, or by the users themselves to provide a holistic solution to a problem instance. 
</p>

<h3>A New Frontier</h3>

<p>	
	This is an exciting project as there is vast potential and many unknowns in harnessing 
	the collectively intelligent web toward addressing hard computational problems. 
</p>

<p>	
	<b>We don't know what kind of contributions users will make, or what will 
	emerge in terms of holistic solutions. </b> For example, you may be interested
	in <a href="http://docs.lib.purdue.edu/jps/vol1/iss1/">this set of papers</a> on assessing human 
	spatial intelligence toward solving instances of the TSP, highlighting the cognitive potential just 
	waiting to be unlocked.
</p>	
<p>
	<b>We don't even know the best way to use the collected data.</b>
	This is an evolving application in an emerging field and we would appreciate any and 
	all <%= link_to 'feedback and ideas', :controller => 'home', :action => 'feedback' %>
	you may have to offer!
